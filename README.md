## Guide to working on the repository

### For each task you do you must create a new branch named after your initials or task.

### Make sure you're on your own branch.

### Open GitHub Desktop and clone this repository to your local device. This allows GitHub to automatically track file changes from your computer.

### Ensure you're on your branch before making changes to the project. Add the project to Unity from the local folder that you just cloned. 'Add project from disk'.

### After making changes in Unity, GitHub Desktop will track them. Commit changes in GitHub Desktop frequently. For example, when you've implemented a working movement script, or when you've tweaked a feature. Remember to push and pull the repo when you're in GitHub Desktop.

### Make sure two people aren't working on the same thing. Person 1 will work on the main scene with camera controls, person 2 will work on a UI scene. They should be on different branches and NOT interfere with each others spaces.

### Update the team whenever you're finished with a feature that is ready to put into the main branch. Frequent communication is important and especially when you when you're working on similar things or spaces as someone else.
